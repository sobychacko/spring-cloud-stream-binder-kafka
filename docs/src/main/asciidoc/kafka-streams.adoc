== Kafka Streams Binder


=== Usage

For using the Kafka Streams binder, you just need to add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, using the following
Maven coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka-streams</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

A quick way to bootstrap a new project for Kafka Streams binder is to use http://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr] and then select "Cloud Streams" and "Spring for Kafka Streams" as shown below

image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/spring-initializr-kafka-streams.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

=== Overview

Spring Cloud Stream includes a binder implementation designed explicitly for https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/[Apache Kafka Streams] binding.
With this native integration, a Spring Cloud Stream "processor" application can directly use the
https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/developer-guide[Apache Kafka Streams] APIs in the core business logic.

Kafka Streams binder implementation builds on the foundations provided by the https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/html/#kafka-streams[Spring for Apache Kafka] project.

Kafka Streams binder provides binding capabilities for the three major types in Kafka Streams - KStream, KTable and GlobalKTable.

Kafka Streams applications typically follow a model in which the records are read from an inbound topic, apply business logic, and then write the transformed records to an outbound topic.
Alternatively, a Processor application with no outbound destination can be defined as well.

In the following sections, we are going to look at the details of Spring Cloud Stream's integration with Kafka Streams.

=== Programming Model

When using the programming model provided by Kafka Streams binder, both the high-level https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html[Streams DSL] and the lower level https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/processor-api.html[Processor-API] can be used as options.

==== Functional Style

Starting with Spring Cloud Stream 3.0, Kafka Streams binder allows the applications to be designed and developed using the functional programming style that is available in Java 8.
This means that the applications can be concisely represented as a lambda expression of types `java.util.function.Function` or `java.util.function.Consumer`.

Let's take a very basic example.

[source]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SimpleConsumerApplication {

    @Bean
    public java.util.function.Consumer<KStream<Object, String>> process() {

        return input ->
                input.foreach((key, value) -> {
                    System.out.println("Key: " + key + " Value: " + value);
                });
    }
}
----

Albeit simple, this is a complete standalone Spring Boot application that is leveraging Kafka Streams for stream processing.
This is a consumer application with no outbound binding and only a single inbound binding.
The application consumes data and it simply logs the transformation as standard output.
The application contains the `SpringBootApplication` annotation and a method that is marked as `Bean`.
The bean method is of type `java.util.function.Consumer` which is parameterized with `KStream`.
Then in the implementation, we are returning a Consumer object that is essentially a lambda expression.
Inside the lambda expression, the code for processing the data is provided.

In this application, there is a single input binding that is of type `KStream`.
The binder creates this binding for the application with a name `process_in`, i.e. the name of the function bean name followed by an underscore and the literal `in`.
You use this binding name to set other properties such as destination.
For example, `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.process_in.destinaion=my-topic`.

Once built as a uber-jar (e.g., `kstream-consumer-app.jar`), you can run the above example like the following.

[source]
----
java -jar `kstream-consumer-app.jar --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.process_in.destinaion=my-topic --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=count
----

Here is another example, where it is a full processor with both input and output bindings.
This is the classic word-count example in which the application receives data from a topic, the number of occurrences for each word is then computed in a tumbling time-window.

[source]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class WordCountProcessorApplication {

  @Bean
  public Function<KStream<Object, String>, KStream<?, WordCount>> process() {

    return input -> input
        .flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
        .map((key, value) -> new KeyValue<>(value, value))
        .groupByKey(Serialized.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.String()))
        .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(5000))
        .count(Materialized.as("word-counts-state-store"))
        .toStream()
        .map((key, value) -> new KeyValue<>(null, new WordCount(key.key(), value,
            new Date(key.window().start()), new Date(key.window().end()))));
  }

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(WordCountProcessorApplication.class, args);
	}
}
----

Here again, this is a complete Spring Boot application. The difference here from the first application, though, the bean method is of type `java.util.function.Function`.
The first parameterized type for the `Function` is for the input `KStream` and the second one is for the output.
In the method body, a lambda expression is provided that is of type `Function` and as implementation, the actual business logic is given.
Similar to the previously discussed Consumer based application, the input binding here is named as `process_in` by default. For the output, the binding name is automatically also set to `process_out`.

Once built as a uber-jar (e.g., `wordcount-processor.jar`), you can run the above example like the following.

[source]
----
java -jar wordcount-processor.jar  --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.process_in.destination=words --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.process_out.destination=counts
----

This application will consume messages from the Kafka topic `words` and the computed results are published to an output
topic `counts`.

Spring Cloud Stream will ensure that the messages from both the incoming and outgoing topics are automatically bound as
KStream objects. As a developer, you can exclusively focus on the business aspects of the code, i.e. writing the logic
required in the processor. Setting up the Streams DSL specific configuration required by the Kafka Streams infrastructure
is automatically handled by the framework.

The two examples we saw above have a single `KStream` input binding. In both cases, the bindings received the records from a single topic.
If you want to multiplex multiple topics into a single `KStream` binding, you can provide comma separated Kafka topics as destinations below.

`spring.cloud.stream.bindings.process_in.destination=topic-1,topic-2,topic-3`

===== Multiple Input Bindings

Any non-trivial Kafka Streams applications often consume data from more than one topic through multiple bindings.
For instance, one topic is consumed as `Kstream` and another as `KTable` or `GlobalKTable`.
There are many reasons why an application might want to receive data as a table type.
Think of a use-case where the underlying topic is populated through a change data capture (CDC) mechanism from a database or perhaps the application only cares about the latest updates for downstream processing.
If the application specifies that the data needs to be bound as `KTable` or `GlobalKTable`, then Kafka Streams binder will properly bind the destination to a `KTable` or `GlobalKTable` and make them available for the application to operate upon.
We will look at a few different scenarios how multiple input bindings are handled in the Kafka Streams binder.

====== BiFunction in Kafka Streams Binder

Here is an example where we have two inputs and an output. In this case, the application can leverage on `java.util.function.BiFunction`.

[source]
----
@Bean
public BiFunction<KStream<String, Long>, KTable<String, String>, KStream<String, Long>> process() {
    return (userClicksStream, userRegionsTable) -> (userClicksStream
            .leftJoin(userRegionsTable, (clicks, region) -> new RegionWithClicks(region == null ?
                            "UNKNOWN" : region, clicks),
                    Joined.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long(), null))
            .map((user, regionWithClicks) -> new KeyValue<>(regionWithClicks.getRegion(),
                    regionWithClicks.getClicks()))
            .groupByKey(Serialized.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()))
            .reduce(Long::sum)
            .toStream());
}
----

Here again, the basic theme is the same as previous examples, the difference, though, you have two inputs and the Java's BiFunction support is used to bind the inputs to the desired destinations.
The default binding names generated by the binder for the inputs are `process_in_0` and `process_in_1` respectively. The default output binding remains to be `process_out`.
In this example, the first parameter of `BiFunction` is bound as a `KStream` for the first input and the second parameter is bound as a `KTable`.

====== BiConsumer in Kafka Streams Binder

If there are two inputs, but no outputs, in that case we can use `java.util.funcion.BiConsumer`.
Here is a blueprint for such an application.

[source]
----
@Bean
public BiConsumer<KStream<String, Long>, KTable<String, String>> process() {
    return (userClicksStream, userRegionsTable) -> {}
}
----

What if you have more than two inputs?
There are situations in which you need more than two inputs. In that case, the binder allows you to chain partial functions. In functional programming jargon, this technique is generally known as currying.
With the functional programming support added as part of Java 8, Java now enables you to write curried functions.
The Kafka Streams binder can make use of this feature to enable multiple input bindings.

Let's see an example.

[source]
----
@Bean
public Function<KStream<Long, Order>,
        Function<GlobalKTable<Long, Customer>,
                Function<GlobalKTable<Long, Product>, KStream<Long, EnrichedOrder>>>> process() {

    return orders -> (
              customers -> (
                    products -> (
                        orders.join(customers,
                            (orderId, order) -> order.getCustomerId(),
                                (order, customer) -> new CustomerOrder(customer, order))
                                .join(products,
                                        (orderId, customerOrder) -> customerOrder
                                                .productId(),
                                        (customerOrder, product) -> {
                                            EnrichedOrder enrichedOrder = new EnrichedOrder();
                                            enrichedOrder.setProduct(product);
                                            enrichedOrder.setCustomer(customerOrder.customer);
                                            enrichedOrder.setOrder(customerOrder.order);
                                            return enrichedOrder;
                                        })
                        )
                )
    );
}
----

In this model, we have 3 partial functions as inputs. The first function has the first input binding of the application (`Order`) and its output is another function.
This output function's input is the second input binding for the application (`Customer`) and its output is another function.
This output function's input is the third input for the application (Product) and its output is a KStream which is final output binding for the application.
The input from the three partial functions which are `KStream`, `GlobalKTable`, `GlobalKTable` respectively are available for you in the method body for implementing the business logic as part of the lambda expression.

Input bindings are named as `process_in_0`, `process_in_1` and `process_in_2` respectively. Output binding is named as `process_out`.

With curried functions, you can virtually have any number of inputs. However, keep in mind that, anything more than a smaller number of inputs and partially applied functions for them as above in Java might lead to unreadable code.
Therefore if your Kafka Streams application requires more than a reasonably smaller number of input bindings and you want to use this functional model, then you may want to rethink your design and decompose the application appropriately.

===== Multiple Output Bindings

Kafka Streams allows to write outbound data into multiple topics. This feature is known as branching in Kafka Streams.
When using multiple output bindings, you need to provide an array of KStream (`KStream[]`) as the outbound return type.

Here is an example:

[source]
----
@Bean
public Function<KStream<Object, String>, KStream<?, WordCount>[]> process() {

    Predicate<Object, WordCount> isEnglish = (k, v) -> v.word.equals("english");
    Predicate<Object, WordCount> isFrench = (k, v) -> v.word.equals("french");
    Predicate<Object, WordCount> isSpanish = (k, v) -> v.word.equals("spanish");

    return input -> input
            .flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
            .groupBy((key, value) -> value)
            .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(5000))
            .count(Materialized.as("WordCounts-branch"))
            .toStream()
            .map((key, value) -> new KeyValue<>(null, new WordCount(key.key(), value,
                    new Date(key.window().start()), new Date(key.window().end()))))
            .branch(isEnglish, isFrench, isSpanish);
}
----

The programming model remains the same, however the outbound parameterized type is `KStream[]`.
The default output binding names are `process_out_0`, `process_out_1`, `process_out_2` respectively.

===== Function based Programming Styles for Kafka Streams

In summary, the following table shows the various options that can be used in the functional paradigm.

|===
|Number of Inputs |Number of Outputs |Component to use

|1|0|java.util.function.Consumer
|2|0|java.util.function.BiConsumer
|1|1..n |java.util.function.Function
|2|1..n |java.util.function.BiFunction
|>= 3 |0..n |Use curried functions

|===

* In the case of more than one output in this table, the type simply becomes `KStream[]`.

==== Imperative programming model.

Although the functional programming model outlined above is the preferred approach, you can still use the classic `StreamListener` based approach if you prefer.

Here are some examples.

Following is the equivalent of the Word count example using `StreamListener`.

[source]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(KafkaStreamsProcessor.class)
public class WordCountProcessorApplication {

    @StreamListener("input")
    @SendTo("output")
    public KStream<?, WordCount> process(KStream<?, String> input) {
        return input
                .flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
                .groupBy((key, value) -> value)
                .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(5000))
                .count(Materialized.as("WordCounts-multi"))
                .toStream()
                .map((key, value) -> new KeyValue<>(null, new WordCount(key.key(), value, new Date(key.window().start()), new Date(key.window().end()))));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(WordCountProcessorApplication.class, args);
    }
----

As you can see, this is a bit more verbose since you need to provide `EnableBinding` and the other extra annotations like `StreamListener` and `SendTo` to make it a complete application.
`EnableBinding` is where you specify your binding interface that contains your bindings.
In this case, we are using the stock `KafkaStreamsProcessor` binding interface that has the following contracts.

[source]
----
public interface KafkaStreamsProcessor {

	@Input("input")
	KStream<?, ?> input();

	@Output("output")
	KStream<?, ?> output();

}
----

Binder will create bindings for the input `KStream` and output `KStream` since you are using a binding interface that contains those declarations.

In addition to the obvious differences in the programming model offered in the functional style, one particular thing that needs to be mentioned here is that the binding names are what you specify in the binding interface.
For example, in the above application, since we are using `KafkaStreamsProcessor`, the binding names are `input` and `output`.
Binding properties need to use those names. For instance `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination`,  `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination` etc.
Keep in mind that this is fundamentally different from the functional style since there the binder generates binding names for the application.
This is because the application does not provide any binding interfaces in the functional model using `EnableBinding`.

Here is another example of a sink where we have two inputs.

[source]
----
@EnableBinding(KStreamKTableBinding.class)
.....
.....
@StreamListener
public void process(@Input("inputStream") KStream<String, PlayEvent> playEvents,
                    @Input("inputTable") KTable<Long, Song> songTable) {
                    ....
                    ....
}

interface KStreamKTableBinding {

    @Input("inputStream")
    KStream<?, ?> inputStream();

    @Input("inputTable")
    KTable<?, ?> inputTable();
}

----

Following is the `StreamListener` equivalent of the same `BiFunction` based processor that we saw above.


[source]
----
@EnableBinding(KStreamKTableBinding.class)
....
....

@StreamListener
@SendTo("output")
public KStream<String, Long> process(@Input("input") KStream<String, Long> userClicksStream,
                                     @Input("inputTable") KTable<String, String> userRegionsTable) {
....
....
}

interface KStreamKTableBinding extends KafkaStreamsProcessor {

    @Input("inputX")
    KTable<?, ?> inputTable();
}
----

Finally, here is the `StreamListener` equivalent of the application with three inputs and curried functions.

[source]
----
@EnableBinding(CustomGlobalKTableProcessor.class)
...
...
    @StreamListener
		@SendTo("output")
		public KStream<Long, EnrichedOrder> process(
				@Input("input-1") KStream<Long, Order> ordersStream,
				@Input("input-"2) GlobalKTable<Long, Customer> customers,
				@Input("input-3") GlobalKTable<Long, Product> products) {

			KStream<Long, CustomerOrder> customerOrdersStream = ordersStream.join(
					customers, (orderId, order) -> order.getCustomerId(),
					(order, customer) -> new CustomerOrder(customer, order));

			return customerOrdersStream.join(products,
					(orderId, customerOrder) -> customerOrder.productId(),
					(customerOrder, product) -> {
						EnrichedOrder enrichedOrder = new EnrichedOrder();
						enrichedOrder.setProduct(product);
						enrichedOrder.setCustomer(customerOrder.customer);
						enrichedOrder.setOrder(customerOrder.order);
						return enrichedOrder;
					});
		}

    interface CustomGlobalKTableProcessor {

            @Input("input-1")
            KStream<?, ?> input1();

            @Input("input-2")
            GlobalKTable<?, ?> input2();

            @Input("input-3")
            GlobalKTable<?, ?> input3();

            @Output("output")
            KStream<?, ?> output();
    }

----

You might notice that the above two examples are even more verbose since in addition to provide `EnableBinding`, you also need to write your own custom binding interface as well.
Using the functional model, you can avoid all those ceremonial details.

Before we move on looking at the general programming model offered by Kafka Streams binder, here is the `StreamListener` version of multiple output bindings.

[source]
----
EnableBinding(KStreamProcessorWithBranches.class)
public static class WordCountProcessorApplication {

    @Autowired
    private TimeWindows timeWindows;

    @StreamListener("input")
    @SendTo({"output1","output2","output3})
    public KStream<?, WordCount>[] process(KStream<Object, String> input) {

			Predicate<Object, WordCount> isEnglish = (k, v) -> v.word.equals("english");
			Predicate<Object, WordCount> isFrench =  (k, v) -> v.word.equals("french");
			Predicate<Object, WordCount> isSpanish = (k, v) -> v.word.equals("spanish");

			return input
					.flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
					.groupBy((key, value) -> value)
					.windowedBy(timeWindows)
					.count(Materialized.as("WordCounts-1"))
					.toStream()
					.map((key, value) -> new KeyValue<>(null, new WordCount(key.key(), value, new Date(key.window().start()), new Date(key.window().end()))))
					.branch(isEnglish, isFrench, isSpanish);
    }

    interface KStreamProcessorWithBranches {

    		@Input("input")
    		KStream<?, ?> input();

    		@Output("output1")
    		KStream<?, ?> output1();

    		@Output("output2")
    		KStream<?, ?> output2();

    		@Output("output3")
    		KStream<?, ?> output3();
    	}
}
----

To recap, we have reviewed the various programming model choices when using the Kafka Streams binder.

The binder provides binding capabilities for `KStream`, `KTable` and `GlobalKTable` on the input.
`KTable` and `GlobalKTable` bindings are only available on the input.
Binder supports both input and output bindings for `KStream`.

The upshot of the programming model of Kafka Streams binder is that the binder provides you the flexibility of going with a fully functional programming model or using the `StreamListener` based imperative approach.

=== Ancillary to the programming model

==== Kafka Streams Application ID

Application id is a mandatory property that you need to provide for a Kafka Streams application.
Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Streams binder allows you to configure this application id in multiple ways.

If you only have one single processor in the application, then you can set this at the binder level using the following property:

`spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.applicationId`.

As a convenience, if you only have a single processor, you can also use `spring.application.name` as the property to delegate the application id.

If you have multiple Kafka Streams processors in the application, then you need to set the application id per processor.
You can set this on the input binding on each processor.

For e.g. imagine that you have to two following functions.

```
@Bean
public java.util.function.Consumer<KStream<Object, String>> process() {
   ...
}
```

and

```
@Bean
public java.util.function.Consumer<KStream<Object, String>> anotherProcess() {
  ...
}
```

Then you must set the application id for each, using the following binding properties.

`spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.process_in.applicationId`

and

`spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.anotherProcess_in.applicationId`

For production deployments, it is highly recommended to explicitly specify the application ID through configuration.
This is especially going to be very critical if you are auto scaling your application in which case you need to make sure that you are deploying each instance with the same application ID.

If the application does not provide an application ID, then in that case the binder will auto generate a random application ID for you.
This is convenient in development scenarios as it avoids the need for explicitly providing the application ID.
Please keep in mind that when you rely on this, each time you start the application, it starts with a brand new application id.
In the case of functional model, the generated application ID will be the function bean name followed by a `UUID` which is then postfixed with the literal `applicationID`.
In the case of `StreamListener`, instead of using the function bean name, the generated application ID will be use the containing class name followed by the method name.

====== Summary of setting Application ID

* Auto generated by the binder per processor in the application. This can be overridden by setting at the binding level such as `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.process_in.applicationId`.
When you have more than one processor, then you have to choose one of these options - either fall back to the defaults or override per input binding.
* If you have a single processor, then you can use `spring.kafka.streams.applicationId`, `spring.application.name` or `spring.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.streams.applicationId`.

==== Custom bindings in the functional style

By default, the binder uses the strategy discussed out above to generate the binding name when using the functional style, i.e. <function-bean-name>_<in>|<out>_[0..n], for e.g. process_in, process_in_0 etc.
If you want to override those binding names, you can do that by specifying the following properties.

`spring.cloud.stream.function.inputBindings.<function-bean-name>`.

For e.g. lets say, you have this function.

[source]
----
@Bean
public BiFunction<KStream<String, Long>, KTable<String, String>, KStream<String, Long>> process() {
...
}
----

Binder will generate bindings with names, `process_in_0`, `process_in_1` and `process_out`.
Now, if you want to change them to something else completely, maybe more domain specific binding names. You can do so, as below.

`springc.cloud.stream.function.inputBindings.process=users,regions`

and

`spring.cloud.stream.function.outputBindings.process=clicks`

After that, you must set all the binding level properties on these new binding names.

Please keep in mind that with the functional programming model described above, sticking with the default binding names make sense in most situations.
The only reason you may still want to do this overriding is when you have larger number of configuration properties and you want to map the bindings to something more domain friendly.

==== Setting up bootstrap server configuration

When running Kafka Streams applications, you must provide the Kafka broker server information.
If you don't provide this information, the binder expects that you are running the broker at the default `localhost:9092`.
If that is not the case, then you need to override that. There are a couple of ways to do that.

* Using the boot property - `spring.kafka.bootstrapServers`
* Binder level property - `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.brokers`

When it comes to the binder level property, it doesn't matter if you use the broker property provided through the regular Kafka binder - `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers`.
Kafka Streams binder will first check if Kafka Streams binder specific broker property is set (`spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.brokers`)  and if nothing found, it looks for `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers`.

=== Record serialization and deserialization

Kafka Streams binder allows you to serialize and deserialize records in two ways.
One is the native serialization and deserialization facilities provided by Kafka and the other one is the message conversion capabilities of Spring Cloud Stream framework.
Lets look at some details.

==== Inbound deserialization

Keys are always deserialized by native Serdes.

By default, for values, deserialization on the inbound is natively performed by Kafka.
Please note that this is a major change on default behavior from previous versions of Kafka Streams binder in which case the deserialization was done by the framework.

Kafka Streams binder will try to infer matching Serde types by looking at the type signature of `java.util.function.Function|Consumer` or `StreamListener`.
Here is the order that it matches Serdes.

 * First it looks at the types and see if they are one of the types exposed by Kafka Streams. If so, use them.
  Here are the Serde types that the binder will try to match from Kafka Streams.

  Integer, Long, Short, Double, Float, byte[] and String.

 * If none of the Serdes provided by Kafka Streams don't match the types, then it will use JsonSerde provided by Spring Kafka. In this case, the binder assumes that the types are JSON friendly.
 This is useful if you have multiple value objects as inputs since the binder will internally infer them to correct json Serde objects. Otherwise, you have to configure Serde and target types on them individually.

If none of the above strategies worked, then the applications must provide the Serdes through configuration.
This can be configured in two ways - binding or default.

First the binder will look if a Serde is provided at the binding level.
For e.g. if you have the following processor,

```
@Bean
public BiFunction<KStream<CustomKey, AvroIn1>, KTable<CustomKey, AvroIn2>, KStream<CustomKey, AvroOutput>> process() {...}
```

then, you can provide a binding level Serde using the following:

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.process_in_0.keySerde=CustomKeySerde
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.process_in_0.valueSerde=io.confluent.kafka.streams.serdes.avro.SpecificAvroSerde

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.process_in_1.keySerde=CustomKeySerde
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.process_in_1.valueSerde=io.confluent.kafka.streams.serdes.avro.SpecificAvroSerde
```

If you want the default key/value Serdes to be used for inbound deserialization, you can do so at the binder level.

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.key.serde
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.value.serde
```

If you don't want the native decoding provided by Kafka, you can rely on the message conversion features that Spring Cloud Stream provides.
Since native decoding is the default, in order to let Spring Cloud Stream deserialze the inbound value object, you need to explicitly disable native decoding.

For e.g. if you have the same BiFunction processor as above, then `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.process_in_0.nativeDecoding: false`
You need to disable native decoding for all the inputs individually. Otherwise, native decoding will still be applied for those you don't disable.

By default, Spring Cloud Stream will use `application/json` as the content type and use an appropriate json message converter.
You can use custom message converters by using the following property.
```
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.process_in_0.contentType
```

==== Outbound serialization

Outbound serialization pretty much follows the same rules as above for inbound deserialization.
As with the inbound deserialization, one major change from the previous versions of Spring Cloud Stream is that the serialization on the outbound is handled by Kafka natively.
Before 3.0 versions of the binder, this was done by the framework itself.

Keys on the outbound are always serialized by Kafka using a matching Serde that is inferred by the binder.
If it can't infer the type of the key, then that needs to be specified using configuration.

Value serdes are inferred using the same rules used for inbound deserialization.
First it matches to see if the outbound type is of a Serde exposed by Kafka such as - Long, Short, Double, Float, byte[] and String.
If that doesnt't work, then fall back to JsonSerde provided by the Spring Kafka project.
Keep in mind that all these happen transparently to the application.
If none of these work, then the user has to provide the Serde to use by configuration.

Lets say you are using the same `BiFunction` processor as above. Then you can configure outbound key/value Serdes as following.

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.process_out.keySerde=CustomKeySerde
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.process_out.valueSerde=io.confluent.kafka.streams.serdes.avro.SpecificAvroSerde
```
However, falling back to default Serdes for both input deserialization and output serialization is the last resort.
This may or may not work. Therefore, you need to ensure that you have a path forward for the application to correctly retrive the Serde.

If Serde inference fails, no binding level Serdes are provided, then the binder falls back to the default Serdes.

`spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.key.serde`
`spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.value.serde`

If your application uses the branching feature and has multiple output bindings, then these have to be configured per binding.
Once again, if the binder is capable of inferring the Serde types, you don't need to do this configuration.

If you don't want the native encoding provided by Kafka, but want to use the framework provided message conversion, then you need to explicitly disable native decoding since since native decoding is the default.
For e.g. if you have the same BiFunction processor as above, then `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.process_out.nativeEncoding: false`
You need to disable native encoding for all the output individually in the case of branching. Otherwise, native encoding will still be applied for those you don't disable.

By default, Spring Cloud Stream will use `application/json` as the content type and use an appropriate json message converter.
You can use custom message converters by using the following property.
```
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.process_output.contentType
```

When native encoding/decoding is disabled, binder will not do any inference as in the case of native Serdes.
Applications need to explicitly provide all the configuration options.
For that reason, it is generally advised to stay with the default options for de/serialization and stick with native de/serialization provided by Kafka Streams when you write Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Streams applications.
The one scenario in which you must use message conversion capabilities provided by the framework is when your upstream producer is using a specific serialization strategy.
In that case, you want to use a matching deserialization strategy as native mechanisms may fail.

=== Configuration Options

This section contains the configuration options used by the Kafka Streams binder.

For common configuration options and properties pertaining to binder, refer to the <<binding-properties,core documentation>>.

==== Kafka Streams Properties

The following properties are available at the binder level and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.`

configuration::
  Map with a key/value pair containing properties pertaining to Apache Kafka Streams API.
  This property must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.`.
 Following are some examples of using this property.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.key.serde=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes$StringSerde
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.default.value.serde=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes$StringSerde
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.commit.interval.ms=1000
----

For more information about all the properties that may go into streams configuration, see StreamsConfig JavaDocs in
Apache Kafka Streams docs.

brokers::
 Broker URL
+
Default: `localhost`
zkNodes::
 Zookeeper URL
+
Default: `localhost`
serdeError::
 Deserialization error handler type.
 Possible values are - `logAndContinue`, `logAndFail` or `sendToDlq`
+
Default: `logAndFail`
applicationId::
 Convenient way to set the application.id for the Kafka Streams application globally at the binder level.
 If the application contains multiple functions or `StreamListener` methods, then the application id should be set at the binding level per input binding.
 See above where setting the application id is discussed in detail.
+
Default: `none`

The following properties are _only_ available for Kafka Streams producers and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.<binding name>.producer.`
For convenience, if there multiple output bindings and they all require a common value, that can be configured by using the prefix `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.default.producer.`.

keySerde::
  key serde to use
+
Default: See the above discussion on message de/serialization
valueSerde::
  value serde to use
+
Default: See the above discussion on message de/serialization
useNativeEncoding::
  flag to enable/disable native encoding
+
Default: `true`.

The following properties are available for Kafka Streams consumers and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.<binding-name>.consumer.`
For convenience, if there are multiple input bindings and they all require a common value, that can be configured by using the prefix `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.default.consumer.`.

applicationId::
 Setting application.id per input binding.
+
Default: `none`
keySerde::
  key serde to use
+
Default: See the above discussion on message de/serialization
valueSerde::
  value serde to use
+
Default: See the above discussion on message de/serialization
materializedAs::
  state store to materialize when using incoming KTable types
+
Default: `none`.
useNativeDecoding::
  flag to enable/disable native decoding
+
Default: `true`.
dlqName::
  DLQ topic name.
+
Default: `none`.
startOffset::
  Offset to start from if there is no committed offset to consume from.
  This is mostly used when the consumer is consuming from a topic for the first time. Kafka Streams uses `earliest` as the default strategy and
  the binder uses the same default. This can be overridden to `latest` using this property.
+
Default: `earliest`.

Note: Using `resetOffsets` on the consumer does not have any effect on Kafka Streams binder.
Unlike the message channel based binder, Kafka Streams binder does not seek to beginning or end on demand.

=== Materializing KTable as a State Store.

Lets say you have the following function.

[source]
----
@Bean
public BiFunction<KStream<String, Long>, KTable<String, String>, KStream<String, Long>> process() {
   ...
}
----

In the case of incoming KTable, if you want to materialize the computations to a state store, you have to express it
through the following property.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.process_in_1.consumer.materializedAs: incoming-store
----

=== Error Handling

Apache Kafka Streams provide the capability for natively handling exceptions from deserialization errors.
For details on this support, please see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-161%3A+streams+deserialization+exception+handlers[this]
Out of the box, Apache Kafka Streams provide two kinds of deserialization exception handlers - `logAndContinue` and `logAndFail`.
As the name indicates, the former will log the error and continue processing the next records and the latter will log the
error and fail. `LogAndFail` is the default deserialization exception handler.

=== Handling Deserialization Exceptions

Kafka Streams binder supports a selection of exception handlers through the following properties.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.serdeError: logAndContinue
----

In addition to the above two deserialization exception handlers, the binder also provides a third one for sending the erroneous
records (poison pills) to a DLQ topic. Here is how you enable this DLQ exception handler.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.serdeError: sendToDlq
----
When the above property is set, all the deserialization error records are automatically sent to the DLQ topic.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.input.consumer.dlqName: foo-dlq
----

If this is set, then the error records are sent to the topic `foo-dlq`. If this is not set, then it will create a DLQ
topic with the name `error.<input-topic-name>.<group-name>`.

A couple of things to keep in mind when using the exception handling feature in Kafka Streams binder.

* The property `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.serdeError` is applicable for the entire application. This implies
that if there are multiple `StreamListener` methods in the same application, this property is applied to all of them.
* The exception handling for deserialization works consistently with native deserialization and framework provided message
conversion.

==== Handling Non-Deserialization Exceptions

For general error handling in Kafka Streams binder, it is up to the end user applications to handle application level errors.
As a side effect of providing a DLQ for deserialization exception handlers, Kafka Streams binder provides a way to get
access to the DLQ sending bean directly from your application.
Once you get access to that bean, you can programmatically send any exception records from your application to the DLQ.

It continues to remain hard to robust error handling using the high-level DSL; Kafka Streams doesn't natively support error
handling yet.

However, when you use the low-level Processor API in your application, there are options to control this behavior. See
below.

[source]
----
@Autowired
private SendToDlqAndContinue dlqHandler;

@StreamListener("input")
@SendTo("output")
public KStream<?, WordCount> process(KStream<Object, String> input) {

    input.process(() -> new Processor() {
    			ProcessorContext context;

    			@Override
    			public void init(ProcessorContext context) {
    				this.context = context;
    			}

    			@Override
    			public void process(Object o, Object o2) {

    			    try {
    			        .....
    			        .....
    			    }
    			    catch(Exception e) {
    			        //explicitly provide the kafka topic corresponding to the input binding as the first argument.
                        //DLQ handler will correctly map to the dlq topic from the actual incoming destination.
                        dlqHandler.sendToDlq("topic-name", (byte[]) o1, (byte[]) o2, context.partition());
    			    }
    			}

    			.....
    			.....
    });
}
----

=== State Store

State store is created automatically by Kafka Streams when the DSL is used.
When processor API is used, you need to register a state store manually. In order to do so, you can use `KafkaStreamsStateStore` annotation.
You can specify the name and type of the store, flags to control log and disabling cache, etc.
Once the store is created by the binder during the bootstrapping phase, you can access this state store through the processor API.
Below are some primitives for doing this.

Creating a state store:
[source]
----
@KafkaStreamsStateStore(name="mystate", type= KafkaStreamsStateStoreProperties.StoreType.WINDOW, lengthMs=300000)
public void process(KStream<Object, Product> input) {
    ...
}
----

Accessing the state store:
[source]
----
Processor<Object, Product>() {

    WindowStore<Object, String> state;

    @Override
    public void init(ProcessorContext processorContext) {
        state = (WindowStore)processorContext.getStateStore("mystate");
    }
    ...
}
----

=== Interactive Queries

As part of the public Kafka Streams binder API, we expose a class called `InteractiveQueryService`.
You can access this as a Spring bean in your application. An easy way to get access to this bean from your application is to "autowire" the bean.

[source]
----
@Autowired
private InteractiveQueryService interactiveQueryService;
----

Once you gain access to this bean, then you can query for the particular state-store that you are interested. See below.

[source]
----
ReadOnlyKeyValueStore<Object, Object> keyValueStore =
						interactiveQueryService.getQueryableStoreType("my-store", QueryableStoreTypes.keyValueStore());
----

If there are multiple instances of the kafka streams application running, then before you can query them interactively, you need to identify which application instance hosts the key.
`InteractiveQueryService` API provides methods for identifying the host information.

In order for this to work, you must configure the property `application.server` as below:

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.configuration.application.server: <server>:<port>
----

Here are some code snippets:

[source]
----
org.apache.kafka.streams.state.HostInfo hostInfo = interactiveQueryService.getHostInfo("store-name",
						key, keySerializer);

if (interactiveQueryService.getCurrentHostInfo().equals(hostInfo)) {

    //query from the store that is locally available
}
else {
    //query from the remote host
}
----

=== Accessing the underlying KafkaStreams object

`StreamBuilderFactoryBean` from spring-kafka that is responsible for constructing the `KafkaStreams` object can be accessed programmatically.
Each `StreamBuilderFactoryBean` is registered as `stream-builder` and appended with the `StreamListener` method name.
If your `StreamListener` method is named as `process` for example, the stream builder bean is named as `stream-builder-process`.
Since this is a factory bean, it should be accessed by prepending an ampersand (`&`) when accessing it programmatically.
Following is an example and it assumes the `StreamListener` method is named as `process`

[source]
----
StreamsBuilderFactoryBean streamsBuilderFactoryBean = context.getBean("&stream-builder-process", StreamsBuilderFactoryBean.class);
			KafkaStreams kafkaStreams = streamsBuilderFactoryBean.getKafkaStreams();
----

=== State Cleanup

By default, the `Kafkastreams.cleanup()` method is called when the binding is stopped.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/html/_reference.html#_configuration[the Spring Kafka documentation].
To modify this behavior simply add a single `CleanupConfig` `@Bean` (configured to clean up on start, stop, or neither) to the application context; the bean will be detected and wired into the factory bean.

=== Health Indicator

The health indicator requires the dependency `spring-boot-starter-actuator`. For maven use:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Spring Cloud Stream Binder Kafka Streams provides a health indicator to check the state of the underlying Kafka threads.
Spring Cloud Stream defines a property `management.health.binders.enabled` to enable the health indicator. See the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#_health_indicator[Spring Cloud Stream documentation].

The health indicator provides the following details for each Kafka threads:

* Thread name
* Thread state:  `CREATED`, `RUNNING`, `PARTITIONS_REVOKED`, `PARTITIONS_ASSIGNED`, `PENDING_SHUTDOWN` or `DEAD`
* Active tasks: task ID and partitions
* Standby tasks: task ID and partitions

By default, only the global status is visible (`UP` or `DOWN`). To show the details, the property `management.endpoint.health.show-details` must be set to `ALWAYS` or `WHEN_AUTHORIZED`.
For more details about the health information, see the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-health[Spring Boot Actuator documentation].

NOTE: The status of the health indicator is `UP` if all the Kafka threads registered are in the `RUNNING` state.

==== Using custom state stores in functional applications

You can define custom state stores as beans in your application and those will be detected and added to the Kafka Streams builder by the binder.
Note that, for regular StreamListener based processors, you still need to use the `KafkaStreamsStateStore` annotation for custom state stores.
Here is an example of using custom state stores with functional style described in this section.

[source]
----
@Bean
		public StoreBuilder myStore() {
			return Stores.keyValueStoreBuilder(
					Stores.persistentKeyValueStore("my-store"), Serdes.Long(),
					Serdes.Long());
		}

		@Bean
		public StoreBuilder otherStore() {
			return Stores.windowStoreBuilder(
					Stores.persistentWindowStore("other-store",
							1L, 3, 3L, false), Serdes.Long(),
					Serdes.Long());
		}
----

These state stores can be then accessed by the applications directly.
